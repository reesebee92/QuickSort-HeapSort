# QuickSort-HeapSort

The purpose of this project is to compare different sorting techniques, QuickSort and HeapSort
in particular, and complete an analysis in terms of time and space complexity.

The input values used are ascending, random, and reverse ordered data from 50 values up to
20,000 values.
